## My process

Well, I made this project following some steps:

- HTML:
  - First, I analyzed the design and thought about the overall structure of the project;
  - Then, I structured the HTML, separating the divs, creating the main classes and formatting everything.

- CSS:
  - In CSS I started stylizing the main background and centering the card in the middle of the screen;
  - I configured the card parameters, color, border and the box shadow. I decided to use padding to give a standard spacing to the contents inside the card and a margin to maintain responsiveness, as the design
  - After that, it was just a matter of adjusting the fonts, color, and spacing of the card content. (and create the link hover :p)
  - For the avatar, I created a div with flex display to make the content horizontal, adjusted the spacing and size and the card was ready.
